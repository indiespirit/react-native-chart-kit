# Troubleshooting

## Chart Is Blank

Check that the chart has a real width and height. Most examples use fixed numbers because React Native charts cannot infer size from an unconstrained parent.

```tsx
<LineChart data={data} xKey="date" yKey="value" width={410} height={240} />
```

If the chart is inside a flex layout, measure the parent with `onLayout` and pass the measured width to the chart.

## Expo Go Says The Demo App Is Incompatible

The Expo demo app lives in the public
[`chart-kit/react-native-chart-kit-example`](https://github.com/chart-kit/react-native-chart-kit-example)
repository and installs React Native Chart Kit from npm. If Expo Go cannot open
that local app, update Expo Go, run `npm install` in the example repo, and start
Expo with tunnel mode:

```sh
npm start -- --tunnel
```

## Gestures Do Not Work

Baseline tap, scrub, pan, pinch zoom, and range selector interactions use React Native responder APIs. They do not require `GestureHandlerRootView` or Reanimated.

When a chart lives inside a vertical scroll view, use chart interaction props that lock parent scrolling during the gesture, such as `viewportInteraction={{ pan: true, lockParentScroll: true }}` or range-selector interaction settings.

If an app has its own gesture system, keep chart selection controlled with `selectedIndex`, `viewport`, and `onViewportChange` so parent screens can coordinate dismissal, scrolling, and navigation.

## Labels Clip Or Overlap

Prefer the default `labelStrategy="auto"` before rotating labels manually. For dense charts:

- use `labelStrategy="skip"` for predictable intervals
- use `edgeLabelPolicy="shift"` to keep first and last labels inside the plot
- use `scrollable` and `visiblePoints` for long categorical datasets
- use `yAxisLabelWidth="stable"` when changing the viewport changes y-label length

## Tooltip Is Cut Off

Tooltips are rendered in an overlay above chart content and shifted into the visible viewport. If a custom tooltip clips:

- keep the chart wrapper height equal to the chart `height`
- avoid wrapping the chart in a parent with `overflow: "hidden"` unless intentional
- pass a realistic tooltip `width`
- prefer `positionAnimationDuration` for smooth movement between selected points

## Theme Does Not Apply

Themes flow from `ChartKitProvider`, but per-chart `theme`, `preset`, or explicit series colors win over provider values.

```tsx
<ChartKitProvider mode="dark" preset="aurora">
  <Dashboard />
</ChartKitProvider>
```

If a chart keeps old colors after changing the provider, check for hardcoded `series[].color`, `upColor`, `downColor`, `fill`, or local `theme` overrides.

## Visual Snapshot Changed

Use the public
[`chart-kit/react-native-chart-kit-example`](https://github.com/chart-kit/react-native-chart-kit-example)
app for visual review when a renderer, layout, label, or theme change affects
the preview screens. That app uses the npm package rather than a sibling
checkout of this repository.

## Compatibility Chart Looks Different From v1

The legacy root import preserves common props, data shapes, and v6 `LineChart`
point-slot spacing. It does not preserve old label-clipping bugs, exact SVG node
order, or undocumented internals. The modern `/v2` charts intentionally use
their own layout behavior.

Use [the v1 migration guide](migration/from-v1.md) and [prop mapping](migration/prop-mapping.md) to decide whether the chart should stay on the compatibility surface or move to the modern API.

## Range selector inside a native gesture detector

Use `react-native-chart-kit` 7.0.3 or later if the range-selector window jumps on Android while an ancestor uses `GestureDetector`. The range selector keeps the root-relative touch movement for each drag, so a changed native event target does not reset its local coordinate.

Keep `viewport` and `onViewportChange` connected as shown in the line chart guide. An ancestor native recognizer can still cancel a child responder. If a custom pinch handler also changes the viewport, coordinate the handlers so they do not write competing viewport updates during a range-selector drag. The `rangeSelector.onGestureStart` and `rangeSelector.onGestureEnd` callbacks can control that application state.
